## üåê External resources

### Encrypted PS3 ISOs

To use this program you will need encrypted PS3 disc images (\*.iso files) from the **Redump** group. It will not work with PS3 disc images from **NO-INTRO** or other groups.

1. You can download **Redump**'s encrypted PS3 disc images from one of these links:

    - [Myrient](https://myrient.erista.me/files/Redump/Sony%20-%20PlayStation%203/)
    - [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@cvlt_of_mirrors?query=%22Sony+Playstation+3%22+%22Redump.org%22&sort=title)

2. Once you have your encrypted PS3 disc images, put all the \*.iso files together in the same folder, like this:

    ![screenshot](/Images/Screenshot_02.png)

3. Finally, in the program's user interface you just need to select the directory containing the encrypted PS3 ISO files by doing click in the following button:
    
    ![screenshot](/Images/Screenshot_03.png)

    üí° Tip: You can put all the \*.iso files in a folder with name "Encrypted" inside the program directory to skip this step.

    ‚ùó Note that the program will **not** perform a recursive \*.iso file search.

### Decryption keys

To use this program you will need decryption keys for the **Redump**'s encrypted PS3 ISO files, which are distributed as plain text files that each contain a string of 32 characters long.

1. Download the desired PS3 decryption keys from one of these links:

    - [Archive.org](https://archive.org/download/video_game_keys_and_sbi) (*only need to download the "Disc Keys TXT" zipped archive from here*)
    - [Myrient](https://myrient.erista.me/files/Redump/Sony%20-%20PlayStation%203%20-%20Disc%20Keys%20TXT/)
    - [Aldo's Tools](https://ps3.aldostools.org/dkey.html)
    
2. Once you have your desired decryption keys, put all the \*.dkey files together in the same folder, like this:

    ![screenshot](/Images/Screenshot_01.png)

3. Finally, in the program's user interface you just need to select the directory containing the decryption keys by doing click in the following button: 

    ![screenshot](/Images/Screenshot_04.png)

    üí° Tip: You can put all the \*.dkey files in a folder with name "DKeys" inside the program directory to skip this step.

    ‚ùó Note that the program will **not** perform a recursive \*.dkey file search.

### PS3Dec.exe

To use this program you will need a copy of **PS3Dec.exe** file, which is actually included in this package, however if you want to use your own:

1. Download **PS3Dec.exe** from one of these links: 

    - [al3xtjames's modified version from RomHacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1456/)
           
      *(‚úÖ This is the one tested and already included in the program package)*

    - [al3xtjames's Github repository](https://github.com/al3xtjames/PS3Dec) or one of its [forks](https://github.com/al3xtjames/PS3Dec/forks).

      (*‚ùó I have not tested any of those forks nor checked if they are virus free. Use them at your own risk.*)

       ‚ùó  Do **not** try to use **PS3Dec.exe** from [Redrrx's Github repository](https://github.com/Redrrx/ps3dec), since it was rewrote using a different (incompatible) command-line syntax with my program.

2. Once you have your copy of **PS3Dec.exe**, in the program's user interface you just need to select the **PS3Dec.exe** file by doing click in the following button: 

    ![screenshot](/Images/Screenshot_05.png)

    üí° Tip: You can put the **PS3Dec.exe** inside the program directory - *overwriting the included one or making a backup* -  to skip this step.
